# Project Outline 

This project aims to create an easy to use house-of-quality generator, but it is thinly veiled attempt to improve my python skills, specifically creating UI. 

## Requirements

- No limit for the number of customer requirements 
- No limit for the number of engineering requirements
- Can be an eye sour at the start, but must have a plan on creating a solid UI down the road. 
- The contents must be easy to navigate 
- The output must be easy to save and print 
- Use as few packages as possible; UI packs are fine 
- Make it easy to develop, expand, and maintain

## Development 

The project will be developed in stages. 

### Stage 1 
Create a python application that displays its contents in a web browser. Must have all the basic navigation features like buttons, teaboxes, and dropdowns.

### Stage 2
Create a mechanism for generating the house of quality. At the end of this stage the result must be an arbitrary sized table with ability to change its shape as needed.

This stage must also start investigating option of making the tool look nice, but it does not have to implement it. 

### Stage 3 
Add other functionality like saving, printing, navigating, etc.
